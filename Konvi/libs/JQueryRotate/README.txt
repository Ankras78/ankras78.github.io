   ÏÎÂÎÐÎÒ ÊÀÐÒÈÍÎÊ <<<< jQuery ïëàãèí

Overview:

This project allows you to simply rotate image by any degree. It uses CSS3 where applicable and 
falls back to a CANVAS (old firefox, some less known browsers) or VML (IE6) solution where possible. 
It also gives some simple interface to animate rotation. Keep in mind that primary usage of this 
plugin is to only rotate "IMG" elements, however experimental version of plugin (ver.3) also rotates 
other elements (yet does not support so many older browsers).

Documentation:

Currently plugin provides interface of few methods:
rotate(angle)
rotate(parameters)
getRotateAngle()
stopRotate()
